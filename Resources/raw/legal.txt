<h3>Intoduction</h3>
Simple task/todo list application with a Widget front-end.<br>
Each task consists of a Task Name and a Note field. The Note field can be of any length.<br>
The task can be given a Priority, a Due Date, a Notification Time, and can be marked as Done.<br>
The display of task on the Widget can be sorted by any combination of Done, Priority and Due Date.<br>

<h3>Notifications</h3>

<h3>Support for multiple task lists</h3>
AutoNag supports multiple task lists.<br>
The name of the list currently being displayed on a Widget is shown at the top together with the number of entries in the list.<br>
Clicking on the list name displays the AutoNag settings screen. This screen allows the list displayed on the Widget to be selected, and allows lists to be 
deleted, renamed and coloured (using a context menu displayed by long-clicking on the list name). Other options allow new task lists to be created, 
the notification tone to be altered and overdue tasks to be highlighted.<br>
Any number of AutoNag Widgets can be displayed. Each widget can display different lists, or the same list<br>
