<h3>Intoduction</h3>
Simple note/todo list application with a Widget front-end.<br>
Each note consists of a Task Name and a Note field. The Note field can be of any length.<br>
The note can be given a Priority, a Due Date, a Notification Time, and can be marked as Done. <br>
The display of notes on the Widget can be sorted by any combination of Done, Priority and Due Date.<br>
 
<h3>Version 2.0 - New features and bug fixes</h3>

1) AutoNag now supports multiple list of notes. The name of the list currently being displayed on an Home Screen widget is shown at the top of the widget.
   Clicking on the list name displays the AutoNag settings screen. This screen allows the currently displayed list to be selected, and allows lists to be 
   created, deleted, renamed and coloured. Any number of AutoNag widgets can be displayed on the Home Screens. Each widget can display different lists, or the
   same list<br>

<h3>Version 2.0 - Known Problems and Missing Features</h3>

1) Showing combined lists. Now that multiple lists are possible, the ability to display all the lists in a single widget would be nice.<br>
