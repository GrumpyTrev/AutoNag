<h3>Intoduction</h3>
Simple note/todo list application with a Widget front-end.<br>
Each note consists of a Task Name and a Note field. The Note field can be of any length.<br>
The note can be given a Priority, a Due Date, a Notification Time, and can be marked as Done. <br>
The display of notes on the Widget can be sorted by any combination of Done, Priority and Due Date.<br>
 
<h3>Version 1.2 - New features and bug fixes</h3>

1) Fixed - Notifications set at the same time as note creation do not contain the correct task identity.  The resulting notifcation does not contain the
   correct details. 

<h3>Version 1.2 - Known Problems and Missing Features</h3>

1) Only a single set of notes can be displayed.  It is intended for multiple sets of notes to be available for display on different Widgets.<br>
2) The colour of the notes is fixed. A colour configuration option may be added at a later date.<br>
